### ✅ **Enhanced Reusability**
- Components can be reused across different parts of the application
- Easier to extend functionality
- Consistent design patterns

### ✅ **Better Scalability**
- New features can be added as separate components

## Technical Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Next.js 14** for the application framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation
- **Supabase** for backend and authentication
- **Lucide Icons** for iconography

## Component Props Structure

Each component accepts well-defined props for:
- Data arrays (items)
- Event handlers (onAdd, onDelete, onUpdate)
- UI state (showAddForm, searchTerm)
- Callback functions for state updates

This structure ensures loose coupling and high cohesion between components.

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for each component
- Implement lazy loading for better performance
- Add more advanced filtering and sorting options
- Implement data export functionality
- Add charts and visualizations for better insights
